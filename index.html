		<h4>History</h4>
        <p1>The internet is evolving, and has evolved, in the world. One of the "Fathers of the Internet", Vint Cerf who co-created the internet, describes his design of the internet with Bob Khan resulting of another experiment called the ARPANET which stood for Advanced Research Project Agency Network. This was a defence department research project. We won't go into too much detail but from this ARPANET, Vint Cerf and Bob khan built what eventually became a nationwide experimental packet network, and it worked.</p1>

        <p1>Living in Wellington city and being from a small town made me realise just how many things out there could potentially be related to the infrastructure of the internet, more so the infrastructure of Wellington. Wellington, being the capital of New Zealand, is such a vibrant and exciting place to live in. Around the city there are numerous CCTV cameras, there has to be because it is such a big place. There are multiple Wi-Fi modems around where I live and around the university as well as cables down almost every street. Stickers on vehicles, kitchen appliances, rubbish bins and other products promote their brands and/or companies by displaying their online website and phone number on the product stickers. It's quite interesting walking around and seeing the amount of advertising that the things in my everyday life inflict upon the public.</p1>
