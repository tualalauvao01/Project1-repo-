	<h3>Wellington City Council</h3>
	<p1>Wellington's sewerage network has evolved over the years, continually improving to reach the high standards we have today. In 2004, Wellington City Council collaborated with Hutt city council to establish what is known as 'Wellington Water' (formerly called Capacity), a non-profit organisation that maintains sewerage, water and stromwater infrastructure for both councils. Sewer discharge into the ocean can happen occasionally, during heavy rainfalls. During heavy rainfalls the Moa Point Wastewater Treatment Plant ocassionally discharges a mixture of fully and partially treated sewage into the Cook.<p1>

<section>
			<p1>The council is responsible for all the maintenance and repairs to the public sewer main. If there is damage caused by fallen trees on Council road reserve, the council will clear the blockage the first time, but if it happens regularly it is not their responsibility. The council has no legal obligation to meet the repair costs of this damage unless the counci caused the damage themselves. However, the design on this manhole is very intricate and depicts the culture of Aotearoa very nicely. It almost looks like waves of the ocean, potentially relating to the sewage system in Wellington.</p1>
