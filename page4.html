			<h1 align="center">Stickers</h1>
			<p1>I never really noticed how many things in my everyday life are internet-related. When I am walking down the street there's always advertisements for certain brands or companies followed by a website url.</p1>

				<h3>Vehicle Stickers</h3>
				<p1>There are plenty of people out there that promote their websites or that advertise their specific brand, company or group to the public by implementing the URL on the bodies of their vehicles. This is just one of them that I saw walking home. It gives off this idea that advertising through stickers on vehicles, or any other object or thing, persuades the public to go online, to go on the Internet and to see these websites. Influencing the Internet on the public.<p1>

				<h3>EnviroWaste</h3>
				<p1>Garbage companies are common in having stickers slapped on their bins with their company name, a phone number and a URL. It's a way for the company to get their business out there, like many others do.</p1>

				<h3>Just Juice</h3>
				<p1>Who doesn't love juice? Juice is tasty but it holds a lot of sugar. Almost all food and drink brands include their details on their product whether that be on stickers or a box. This is so that if there are any problems with the product, like there is a hole it, then you can contact them informing them of this minor mishap. I mean, if this does happen, usually you'd get your money back or you'd get another one for free.</p1>

				<h3>Energy Rating</h3>
				<p1>Now this site is an Australian site (".au"). But I never really noticed the website URL on this fridge sticker. A fridge which I have had for a very long time. It's telling us to compare the energy consumption of our fridge to other models of fridges. That's a pretty neat way to find out what fridge would be better in terms of its energy consumption.<p1>
